## Presidential Candidate Analysis
Tracking the public opinion of the 2020 US Presidential Election candidates

## Why i built this app?
I just wanted to get some hands on expirience on working with a ML project
This project involves webscraping using Twitter's API
and sentiment analysis using TextBlob

## What does this app do?

# Backend Data Collection And Analysis

It searches for tweets related to presidential election candidates, the tweets are identified using hashtags
for example'#sanders2020'. The tweets along with some metadata are stored in csv files

Pandas is then used to analyse the data,  the polarity of the sentiment of the tweet is identified using TextBlob and stored back in the csv files, the pandas aggregation funtions are used to get some statistical measures

# Frontend 

The front end was built using materialze.css , a powerful framework like that and a coder without an ounce of 
artistic creativity dont mix well, so the front end design is so and so , but they fullfill their purpose

## Technology Used

1)The backend is built using Python3 and used Flask 
2)The front end is built using HTML5 and materialze.css

## Any features to that might be added

I might add some graphs , why? because graphs look cool, when? in near future, if i get bored
